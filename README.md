Description: 
The lifter’s purpose is to enable the device to reach higher than the arm itself allows. Consequently, the robot operates within a broader workspace without increasing its size or modifying the arm’s construction.
The project comprises strength calculations, a 3D model of the lifter assembled with carefully selected parts and subassemblies, as well as technical drawings that predominantly consist of assembly views and a few component details. 
It also serves as part of the project assignments from the Fundamentals of Machine Construction course. The work not only demonstrates rigorous analytical and design skills but also highlights a practical approach to solving engineering
challenges while ensuring optimal functionality and structural integrity.
